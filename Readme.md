### Description
A two-layer neural network for image and text classification. The neural network is built using numpy library where the image is flattened to form the input layer and the hidden layer has 14 neurons and the output layer has one neuron predicting the input image.
The following are covered in this repo:
- Develop an intuition of the over all structure of a neural network.

- Write functions (e.g. forward propagation, backward propagation, logistic loss, etc...) that would help you decompose your code and ease the process of building a neural network.

- Initialize/update parameters according to your desired structure.


### Credits
Part of UMD CMSC498L Deep Learning course

The format of this assignment is inspired by the Stanford CS231n assignments. We have borrowed some of their data loading and instructions in our assignment ipython notebook.
